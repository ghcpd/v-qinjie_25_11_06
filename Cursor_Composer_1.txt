You are a software security engineer tasked with auditing and securing a Java Spring Boot web application.
Your responsibilities include:
1. Identify all SQL injection vulnerabilities in the provided Java source code and list each with file name and code line numbers.
2. Detect and report any hardcoded secrets or API keys, also with file name and line numbers.
3. Generate a fully secure, production-ready fixed version of the vulnerable Java file(s).
4. Provide a detailed explanation for each fix, including:
○ Why the issue was a security risk
○ How your change mitigates the vulnerability
○ Verification steps showing that the fix works

5. Generate environment replication scripts for each major platform, including:
	○ requirements.txt, Dockerfile, and setup.sh (for Linux/macOS)
	○ run_test.sh (Linux/macOS), run_test.bat (Windows)
6. Implement automatic test execution:
	○ The script must detect the current environment (Windows/Linux/Docker)
	○ Run the corresponding test script automatically
	○ Save logs to logs/test_run.log
7. Ensure all generated outputs include:
	○ A structured JSON report summarizing detected vulnerabilities, their severity, affected files and lines, and secure replacements
	○ The repaired source file(s) with safe code replacements
	○ Scripts that allow reproducible security verification in each environment

## Security audit complete

### 1. Vulnerabilities identified

**SQL Injection (CRITICAL)** - `input.java:13`
- Direct string concatenation in SQL query
- Fixed with PreparedStatement and parameterized queries

**Hardcoded API Key (HIGH)** - `input.java:7`
- API key exposed in source code
- Fixed with @Value annotation and environment variables

**Hardcoded Database Credentials (CRITICAL)** - `input.java:11`
- Database password exposed in source code
- Fixed with DataSource bean and externalized configuration

### 2. Generated files

**Security reports:**
- `security_audit_report.json` - JSON audit report
- `SECURITY_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md` - Summary document

**Secure code:**
- `UserController_fixed.java` - Fixed secure version
- `Application.java` - Spring Boot application entry point
- `application.properties` - Externalized configuration

**Build & deployment:**
- `pom.xml` - Maven configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Docker container
- `docker-compose.yml` - Full stack deployment

**Test scripts:**
- `setup.sh` - Linux/macOS setup
- `run_test.sh` - Linux/macOS test runner
- `run_test.bat` - Windows test runner
- `auto_test_runner.sh` - Auto-detecting runner (Linux/macOS)
- `auto_test_runner.bat` - Auto-detecting runner (Windows)

### 3. Security fixes

1. SQL injection: Replaced string concatenation with PreparedStatement parameterized queries
2. API key: Externalized using `@Value("${app.api.key}")` with environment variable support
3. Database credentials: Replaced hardcoded connection with DataSource bean and externalized configuration

### 4. Testing

**Windows:**
```cmd
run_test.bat
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x run_test.sh
./run_test.sh
```

**Auto-detecting runner:**
```bash
# Linux/macOS
./auto_test_runner.sh

# Windows  
auto_test_runner.bat
```

All test logs are saved to `logs/test_run.log`.

### 5. JSON report

The `security_audit_report.json` includes:
- Vulnerability details with file locations and line numbers
- Risk assessments and impact analysis
- Fixed code snippets with line references
- Verification steps and expected results
- Environment script references

All files are ready for review and testing. The secure code follows Spring Boot best practices and addresses all identified security vulnerabilities.
